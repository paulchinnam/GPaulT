# GPaulT

A simple GPT

# To run

- Create and activate a python env in the root
- pip install requirements.txt with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- CD into the models directory
- Run the model with `python gpault.py`
- The model will be trained the first time the script runs and the weights will be saved to a path file so it can simply generate for all subsequent runs instead of training every run
